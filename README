Here is the beginning of a project that aims to design a Pymol plugin to help 
to search tunnels and cavities in proteins.


-- Fast demonstration -- (Works if everything is installed. See Requirements)
git clone https://github.com/Gueust/Pymol-Tunnels-Cavities-Finder.git
cd Pymol-Tunnels-Cavities-Finder/build/ && cmake . && make && ./TunnelsCavitiesFinder

To see with geomview : geomview mesh.off
to see with PyMol : pymol cgo.py (require PyMol installed)


-- Requirements --
The compilation process uses CMake.

The CGAL and ESBTL libraries are also required. 
It has been tested with CGAL 4.2 and ESBTL both in May, 2013

- http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs368-00-spring/TA/manuals/CGAL
/installation/Chapter_installation.html
for CGAL
- ESBTL : "git clone git://esbtl.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/esbtl/esbtl" 
and then "sudo cp -r esbtl/include/ESBTL/ /usr/local/include/ESBTL"

(The version at http://esbtl.sourceforge.net/download.html for ESBTL is NOT up-to-date)

To be able to compile directly put ESBTL in /opt or /usr/local/include or
modify the CMakeList.txt in the build directory.
