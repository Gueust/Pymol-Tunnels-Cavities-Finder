Here is the beginning of a project that aims to design a Pymol plugin to help 
to search tunnels and cavities in proteins.


-- Fast demonstration -- (If everything is installed, see Requirements)
git clone https://github.com/Gueust/Pymol-Tunnels-Cavities-Finder.git
cd Pymol-Tunnels-Cavities-Finder/build/ && cmake . && make 

To see with geomview : geomview mesh.off
to see with PyMol : pymol cgo.py


-- Requirements --

This requires the CGAL and ESBTL libraries and works with CGAL 4.0.2 and
ESBTL 1.0-bata01.

- http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs368-00-spring/TA/manuals/CGAL
/installation/Chapter_installation.html
for CGAL
- http://esbtl.sourceforge.net/download.html for ESBTL.

To be able to compile directly put ESBTL in /opt or /usr/local/include or
modify the CMakeList.txt in the build directory.
