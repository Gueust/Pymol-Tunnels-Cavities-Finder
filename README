Here is the beginning of a project that aims to design a Pymol plugin to help 
to serch tunnels and cavities in proteins.

This requires the CGAL and ESBTL libraries and works with CGAL 4.0.2 and
ESBTL 1.0-bata01.

/installation/Chapter_installation.html
for CGAL
- http://esbtl.sourceforge.net/download.html for ESBTL.

To be able to compile directly put ESBTL in /opt or /usr/local/include or
modify the CMakeList.txt in the build directory.
